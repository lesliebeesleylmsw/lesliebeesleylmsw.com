  <p>I believe that we all strive for a healthy level of functioning for ourselves and our families. Sometimes despite our best intentions, we may find that something comes up that we may need a little extra help with. Whether you are experiencing family conflict or facing challenges that can come with being a parent, battling anxiety or depression, adjusting to life after trauma or loss, or having difficulty coping with life's many trials, it is my privilege to help you address your therapeutic needs.</p>
