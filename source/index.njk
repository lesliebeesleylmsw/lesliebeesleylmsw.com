    <p>I believe that we all have the capacity to grow and change unhealthy/unproductive patterns if we have the tools and resources to do so. Whether you are experiencing the pain of watching your child struggle with managing their emotions, behaviors, or relationships at school or at home, or are stuck in a cycle of unhealthy and unproductive family interactions, or would just like additional parenting education, feedback and coaching, it is my privilege to participate in your familyâ€™s growth and change process. I see children and adults, and provide individual as well as family therapy. I treat a variety of issues relevant to and that can cause stress in child and family life such as behavioral issues, school issues, peer relationships, family conflict, parenting, etc. I also treat anxiety, depression, low self esteem, grief, and trauma. I draw from a variety of evidence based treatment approaches and practice from a strengths based and person centered perspective. Together we will determine which approach is best suited for your therapeutic needs and goals.</p>

    <p>I am a licensed Master Social Worker in the State of Kansas. I received my graduate degree in 2010 from the University of Oklahoma (OU). In November 2016, I made the leap from agency practice to opening my private practice in beautiful downtown Lawrence, KS. I am offering a second practice location at Kansas City Mental Health Associates (KCMHA) in Olathe, KS beginning October 2017. My post graduate experience in mental health is varied but has always included work with children and families which happens to be a population that I absolutely love working with. Some of the populations/settings I have had the opportunity to work with include: providing individual and family therapy to children, adults and families in both the community mental health and child welfare settings. I have also worked with parents involved in the court/child welfare systems providing parenting skills, coaching, supervision, feedback and parenting groups.</p>
