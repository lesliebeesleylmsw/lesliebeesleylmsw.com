  <h3>Affordable</h3>
    <p>The ability for all to afford mental healthcare is important to me.  As such I will honor your insurance copay fee as I am not currently set up to accept insurance.  </p>
    <p>For those without insurance I offer a sliding scale fee in an effort to make mental health services affordable for all.</p>
